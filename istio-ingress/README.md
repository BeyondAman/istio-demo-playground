This tutorial is largely based on the work of Kelsey HightowerVerified account [https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower](@kelseyhightower) and this repositories:

[https://github.com/kelseyhightower/istio-ingress-tutorial](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/istio-ingress-tutorial)

Kelsey's tutorial uses more advance features of Kubernetes to taint some of the nodes so that the ingress controller runs on dedicated nodes.  The ingress controller is then deployed as a daemonset.
